Task 1: Weather Forecast Classification
Write a program that accepts an integer representing the temperature in Fahrenheit. Based on the temperature, classify it as one of the following:

Below 32°F: Freezing

Between 32°F and 60°F (inclusive): Cold

Between 61°F and 85°F (inclusive): Warm

Above 85°F: Hot

Additionally, handle edge cases:

If the input is below -100°F, return: "Temperature too low"

If the input is above 150°F, return: "Temperature too high"

Example Input/Output:

Input: 50
Output: Cold

Input: 90
Output: Hot

Input: -120
Output: Temperature too low
